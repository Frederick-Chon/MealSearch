# MealSearch

MealSearch is an app where users can search or generate random meals from the MealDB API. The goal of this project was to practice making different fetch requests to different endpoints and using JavaScript to manipulate the data before displaying it on the DOM. Users will be able to see the recipe, ingredients and an image of the meal.
